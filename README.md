In this work, we propose a novel adversarial neural network, namely SCS-Gan, that can learn a stylometric representation of code for automated AV. With the multi-head attention mechanism, SCS-Gan focuses on the code parts that are most informative regarding personal styles and generates functionality-agnostic stylometric representations through adversarial training. We benchmark SCS-Gan and two state-of-the-art code representation models on four out-of-sample datasets collected from a real-world programming competition. Our experiment results show that SCS-Gan outperforms the baselines on all four out-of-sample datasets.
